### Android App for the The InterPlanetary File System(IPFS)

This App does not represent a full IPFS node yet! Think of it as a dependency injection for IPFS on android. Currently we use the centralized service ipfs.io so you can use ipfs on android - later this will be exchanged for a full-node for decentralisation but all things that use this app don't have to change/care.

### Features:

handles ipfs:// links and display content

### Future features:

* Content Provider
* Document Provider
*
